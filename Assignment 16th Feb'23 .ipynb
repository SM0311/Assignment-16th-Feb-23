    "Answer 1. A database is a collection of data that is organized and managed in a way that enables efficient storage, retrieval, and manipulation of the data. Databases are used to store and manage data for a wide range of applications, including web applications, business applications, scientific research, and more.\n",
    "\n",
    "There are two main types of databases: SQL and NoSQL.\n",
    "\n",
    "SQL (Structured Query Language) databases are relational databases that store data in tables with fixed columns and rows. SQL databases are organized around a schema, which defines the structure of the tables and the relationships between them. SQL databases use SQL to interact with the data, and support a wide range of operations such as querying, inserting, updating, and deleting data.\n",
    "\n",
    "NoSQL (Not Only SQL) databases, on the other hand, are non-relational databases that store data in a variety of ways, such as key-value pairs, documents, graphs, or columns. NoSQL databases are schema-less, meaning that the data can be stored in a flexible way without the need for a predefined schema. NoSQL databases are designed to handle large volumes of unstructured or semi-structured data, and provide high scalability and performance.\n",
    "\n",
    "The main differences between SQL and NoSQL databases can be summarized as follows:\n",
    "\n",
    "Data model: SQL databases use a structured, tabular data model, while NoSQL databases use a variety of data models such as key-value, document, graph, or column.\n",
    "\n",
    "Schema: SQL databases use a schema to define the structure of the data, while NoSQL databases are schema-less and allow for more flexible data storage.\n",
    "\n",
    "Query language: SQL databases use SQL to interact with the data, while NoSQL databases may use a variety of query languages, depending on the data model.\n",
    "\n",
    "Scalability: NoSQL databases are designed to scale horizontally across multiple nodes, while SQL databases typically scale vertically by adding more resources to a single node.\n",
    "\n",
    "Performance: NoSQL databases are optimized for performance, particularly in handling large volumes of data, while SQL databases may be slower when dealing with complex queries or large datasets.\n",
    "\n",
    "Overall, the choice between SQL and NoSQL databases depends on the specific needs of the application and the type of data being stored. SQL databases are often used for applications with well-defined data structures and complex querying needs, while NoSQL databases are preferred for applications that require high scalability, performance, and flexibility in data storage.\n"

    "\n",
    "1. CREATE:\n",
    "The CREATE statement is used to create new database objects such as tables, views, indexes, and procedures. For example, to create a new table named \"students\" with columns \"id,\" \"name,\" and \"age,\" you would use the following command:\n",

    "Answer 5. In database design, a primary key is a field or combination of fields in a database table that uniquely identifies each record in the table. It is a column or set of columns whose values uniquely identify each row in a table. A primary key must be unique, not-null, and immutable. It is used to enforce data integrity by ensuring that there are no duplicate records in a table.\n",
    "\n",
    "For example, consider a table named \"students\" that has columns named \"id,\" \"name,\" and \"age.\" The \"id\" column can be designated as the primary key of the table because it uniquely identifies each record in the table.\n",
    "\n",
    "A foreign key is a field in a database table that refers to the primary key of another table. It is used to establish a relationship between two tables. The foreign key in one table is used to reference the primary key in another table. A foreign key can be used to enforce referential integrity by ensuring that any values in the foreign key column must correspond to existing values in the referenced primary key column.\n",
    "\n",
    "For example, consider a table named \"enrollments\" that has columns named \"student_id\" and \"course_id.\" The \"student_id\" column can be designated as a foreign key that references the \"id\" column of the \"students\" table. This relationship ensures that any value in the \"student_id\" column must correspond to an existing value in the \"id\" column of the \"students\" table, thus ensuring referential integrity.\n",
